* About this Repo...

This repo is setup to facilitate a "learn-as-you-type" journey thru Mike Zamansky's (60+? entries to date) series on learning, configuring, and working with Emacs.

Still thinking about how to structure the files and commits. More as I go...

* Github
#+begin_src shell
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/tsyroid/emacs-zamansky.git
git push -u origin main
#+end_src

* Changelog
